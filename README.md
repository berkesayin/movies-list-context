# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### React Context: an alternative to passing props

- Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient if you have to pass them through many components in the middle, or if many components in your app need the same information.

- Context lets a parent component provide data to the entire tree below it.

- This repository is created to easily use and show `useContext` and `createContext`, preventing prop drilling.

- This is a quite easy and simple movie list app with basic functionality. The purpose here is just to apply `useContext` and `createContext`
